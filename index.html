      <p>
        Kerala Blasters FC will face FC Goa in their 6th game of the season on Sunday,13th November at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium,
        Kochi.
        <br>
        <br />
        Kerala Blasters come into this game with a 3-0 away win over Northeast United FC in their last game where the Blasters returned to winning ways after a three game winless streak.
        Ahead of the game, Ivan Vukomanovic added <strong>We want to get back to the level we were in last season, holding the defence line, having more clean sheets</strong>.The Croatian
        tactician will be hoping to take all three points against Carlos Pena's new look FC Goa.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand,FC Goa have just lost only once in the league this season. They managed to pick up a 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC in their last game.Also, they have the best defence in the league as they have concede just 2 goals so far.
        Based on these stats,It's fair to say Carlos Pena has worked his magic into this FC Goa team. <strong>Weâ€™ll try to adapt and play in the same style that we do so that we can go for all three points again</strong>
        added Carlos Pena.
      </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b class="heading">Head-to-Head:</b></h4>

        9 times out of 16.The other 4 meetings between the sides have ended in a draw. The most recent meeting between the two sides
        came in the last group stage match of ISL last season which ended in a 4-4 draw. FC Goa striker Alvaro Vazquez scored a goal for the blasters that day.
      </p>
      <br />

          <p>
          FC Goa will be without defensive duo Fares Arnaout and Marc Valiente as they both are nursing injuries. It will be a huge loss for Carlos Pena as both of his foreign centre-backs are out for
          all important clash against the Blasters. Alvaro Vazquez is expected to be fit for the upcoming game after missing the last game against Jamshedpur FC.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b class="heading">Probable Lineups:</b></h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Kerala Blasters FC:</strong> Gill(GK), Sandeep Singh, Ruivah Hormipam, Marko Leskovic, Nishu Kumar, Jeakson Singh, Ivan Kalyuzhnyi, Sahal Abdul Samad, Adrian Luna, Rahul KP, Dimitrios Diamantakos.
          <br>
          <br />
          <strong>Mumbai City FC:</strong> Dheeraj Singh(GK), Aibhan Dohling, Glan Martins, Anwar Ali, Seriton Fernandes, Ayush Chhetri, Edu Bedia, Iker Guarrotxena, Brandon Fernandes, Noah Sadaoui, Alvaro Vazquez.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b class="heading">Key Players:</b></h4>
          <p>
            <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfnOrgwacAIbD7H?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" alt="" height=500px>
            <br />
            <strong>Adrian Luna</strong> will be the key player for the Blasters. Luna has already scored a goal and provided an assist in his previous two meetings against the Gaurs. The Uruguayan midfielder has created the joint most big chances
            (3) in the league this season alongside Greg Stewart and Dimitri Petratos and will be hoping to do more in the upcoming game.
            <br>
            <br />

            <strong>Anwar Ali</strong> will be the most important player for the Gaurs. The Indian Defender was arguably the man of the match in their last game against Jamshedpur FC. With Fares and Marc out for the game, a lot of defensive
            responsibilities will rely on the shoulders of Anwar.
